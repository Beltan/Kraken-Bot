# Kraken Bot
This was my first programming project and the objective was to make a bot that automatically buys and sells cryptocurrency on the exchange Kraken. The bot works properly, although profitability is questionable. In the future we will try to make better IAs. A .csv can be created from Kraken historical data and then loaded to the bot as simulation mode in order to check the perfomance of the IA in a large sample of data without having to wait for months and without actually risking money.
